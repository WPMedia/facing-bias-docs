In 2016, [62 percent of Americans](http://www.journalism.org/2016/05/26/news-use-across-social-media-platforms-2016/) got news on social media — a source that is tailored to our interests, opinions and beliefs. Dubbed the “echo chamber,” social media makes it easier than ever to avoid news that we don’t agree with and to isolate ourselves from divergent opinions. Which makes us wonder: What happens in the mind when we read stories that affirm or contradict our opinions? Can our facial expressions reveal bias? With augmented reality, we have an opportunity to put readers in the driver’s seat and empower them to untangle this complex issue with humor, empathy and research personalized to their lives.

### What is the Journalism 360 Challenge?
This project is part of the [Journalism 360 Challenge](https://knightfoundation.org/challenges/journalism-360-challenge), a grant awarded by [Knight Foundation](https://knightfoundation.org), [Google News Lab](https://newslab.withgoogle.com/) and the [Online News Association](https://journalists.org/). The challenge was an open call for ideas using immersive storytelling to discover new ways to engage audiences and advance the field of journalism. 10 other ideas also won.

### How can I get involved?
We plan to open-source parts of our code and all of our process. As we work, we'll be publishing documentation here, and conversing with interested readers, journalists and technologists through a Slack channel.

### Why are we sharing our code and process?
Our goal is to publish content and documentation that is reusable by journalists for their own projects. To do this well, we need your input! When we write about user testing or how we chose an API, let us know what's helpful and what doesn't make any sense. All of our posts will be open for comment, so have at it! ... something else here?
