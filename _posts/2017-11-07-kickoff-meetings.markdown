Before diving into a big project, it's helpful to gather your core team and answer a few questions. This outline is modeled off of A List Apart's “[Kick Ass Kickoff Meetings](https://alistapart.com/article/kick-ass-kickoff-meetings)”. It helps ensure that everyone is on the same page at the beginning of a project and that everyone is involved who should be involved. And by answering “What is the one thing we must get right to make this project worthwhile?” and “What could put this project at risk?”, you avoid all sorts of calamities and mishaps. 

For this project, Seth and I wrote and answered as many questions as we could. Then we reviewed it with our editors and filled in the blanks. You don't need to answer every question before you start, but we highly recommend answering the big picture, organization and scheduling questions before moving forward. The story, design and technical questions are pretty specific to this project, so remember brainstorm your own. 

What are your tips and must-dos before starting a big project? Let us know in the comments! 
  

## Big Picture Questions
1. What is the one thing we must get right to make this project worthwhile? 
2. What is success for this project?
3. What could put this project at risk?
4. What would exceed your wildest dreams?
 
## Specific Questions
#### Organization
1. Who is the decider?
2. Who do we need final sign off from?
3. What teams are working on this?
4. What stakeholders do we need to interview?
5. Do we want to do a sprint week?
6. How are we tracking tasks? 

#### Scheduling
1. How frequently do we want to demo for editorial?
2. How frequently do we want scope check-ins? 
3. What is our meeting cadence? How soon do we start daily scrums?
4. When are we doing user testing and what is it focused on?
5. What is our deadline?

#### Grant
1. What are the formal grant requirements?
2. What else do we want to do to build community?
3. How do we want to structure our documentation?
4. How frequently should we document our process? 

#### Story
1. What scientists are we working with?
2. What topics work for measuring bias?
3. What studies can we use as a starter for this work?
4. How do we use emotion as a measure of bias?
5. What source material will the reader look at?
6. Do we need a written component as the entry point? If yes, who will write?
7. Should we be focusing on a particular type of bias? (Confirmation, availability, anchor, rush to solve, asymmetrical attention?)

#### Design
1. How do we illustrate what we are measuring?
2. How are we going to make onboarding better?
3. How are we going to explain the technology to readers/editorial?
4. What does sharing look like?

#### Technical
1. What platforms can we do this on? Can we do it on the web? 
2. How do we do face tracking on native? 
3. Is the emotion measuring fast enough for this? 
4. What emotion recognition API is the best? How much does it cost?
5. How are we going to make onboarding better? 
6. If we’re working in native, what is our process for updating and testing builds? 
7. What is the server side setup for this? Can we get enough throughput? Does the cost of this bother us at all? What about the long tail?
